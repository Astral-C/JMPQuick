# JMPQuick
A simple and easy to use jmp editor. Supports both Luigi's Mansion 3D and Luigi's Mansion GC jmp files.

## Theres a randomize button?
There is, the randomize feature works with jmp files containing a name field, a dmd_name field, or a type field. Keep in mind that these *will* break the game. Another note is that randomizing furnitureinfo will not work unless the correct models are placed in their respective room archives which takes a little extra leg work. Have fun!
